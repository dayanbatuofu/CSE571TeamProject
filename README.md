Below code should be modified:

dStar.py -- this part has already been done. Please check the code based on algorithm. If you want to get the result, please run the command: 

python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=dstarlite, prob=UnknownPositionSearchProblem, heuristic=manhattanHeuristic --frameTime 0 -z .5

lifelongPlanningAStar.py -- please check based on algorithm (Done)

search.py -- the main algorithm of D* and LPA has been added (Done)

searchAgent.py -- should add Class of 'SearchProblem' which is same as 'ReplanningSearchProblem' in the reference code
